Tryton's based on a EPR system called TinyERP and has been around since 2008. Over its lifetime, Tryton has grown both in popularity and flexibility.
Tryton is aimed at businesses of all sizes, and has a range of modules. Those include accounting, sales, invoicing, project management, shipping, analytics, and inventory management. Tryton's not all or not, though. The system is modular, so you can install only the modules your business needs. While the system is web based, there are desktop clients for Windows and MacOS.
The online demo will give you an idea of what Tryton can do. When you're ready, you can install it using a Docker image, download the source code or get the code from the project's Mercurial repository. The source code, in case you're wondering, is licensed under GPLv3 or later.
