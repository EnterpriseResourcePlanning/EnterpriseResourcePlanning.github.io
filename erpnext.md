ERPNext is one of those classic open source projects; in fact, it was featured on Opensource.com way back in 2014. It was designed to scratch a particular itch, in this case replacing a creaky and expensive proprietary ERP implementation.
ERPNext was built for small and midsized businesses. It includes modules for accounting, managing inventory, sales, purchase, and project management. The applications that make up ERPNext are form-drivenâ€”you fill information in a set of fields and let the application do the rest. The whole suite is easy to use.
If you're interested, you can request a demo before taking the plunge and downloading it or buying a subscription to the hosted service.
