  Dolibarr offers end-to-end management for small and midsize businessesâ€”from keeping track of invoices, contracts, inventory, orders, and payments to managing documents and supporting electronic point-of-sale system. It's all wrapped in a fairly clean interface.
  If you're wondering what Dolibarr can't do, here's some documentation about that.
  In addition to an online demo, Dolibarr also has an add-ons store where you can buy software that extends its features. You can check out its source code on GitHub; it's licensed under GPLv3 or any later version.
